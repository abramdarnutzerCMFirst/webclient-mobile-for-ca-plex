# Introduction #

Most project development revolves around issues. Issues that are found are logged in the issues database and subsequently assigned to developers and milestones in which they'll be fixed. This process helps us ensure that the right things are getting fixed, and the quality of the bug report often determines how quickly the issue will get corrected. The best bug reports include detailed instructions on how to reproduce the bug, an attachment that shows the code for reproducing the issue, or a link to a URL that demonstrates the problem.

# Details #

All bug reports should include the following information:
•Browser type (IE, Firefox, Safari, Chrome)
•Browser version
•OS and OS Version (iOS, Android, Windows, ...)
•All steps necessary to reproduce the issue
•An email address of the person filing the bug or a way to get a hold of him/her.

The better the bug reports, the faster we can fix things, and improving existing bug reports for issues scheduled to be addressed in the next major release is a great way to get involved and speed improvement in the tool. And writing good test cases is just a small step away from writing patches to fix the issues.
